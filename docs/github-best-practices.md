## Creating a Repository

Creating a repository, like starting a new project, can be a bit of a daunting task. These guidelines can help you make sure you your space stays organised!

### 1. Naming Your Repo

While there is a long history of giving repositories proper names, like _LightRAG_ or _Fabric_, in the context of company work, it is important to always label your repositories clearly and **consistently**.

"Clearly" simply means "in a way which is clearly descriptive of the project", whereas "consistently" means making sure you are using **common naming conventions** to ensure your repository names are easily intepretable. Below is a set of recommended naming conventions:

**Quick Rules**

| **Aspect**                                   | **Rule / Example**                                                     | **Explanation**                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Case style (kebab case)**                               | `lowercase-with-hyphens`                                               | Use lowercase letters and hyphens (`-`) to separate words. Avoid spaces or underscores for better readability. |
| **Avoid special characters**                 | ✅ `data-visualization`<br>❌ `data_visualization!`                      | Only use letters, numbers, and hyphens. Special characters can cause issues in URLs.                           |
| **Keep it short and clear**                  | ✅ `math-games`<br>❌ `my-awesome-mathematics-educational-games-project` | Shorter names are easier to remember and type. Aim for 2–4 words that describe the project.                    |
| **Be descriptive**                           | ✅ `quiz-app`<br>❌ `project1`                                           | Use words that describe what the repository does or contains.                                                  |
| **Avoid redundant words**                    | ❌ `repo`, `project`, `codebase`                                        | These words don’t add useful meaning — your repo is already a project!                                         |
