# MAC-OS SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

![Apple Banner](./assets/apple-banner.png)

In this doc you'll find the instructions you need to make sure you're ready to go for vibe-coding from your MacOS terminal!

# üß™ CREATE A GITHUB ACCOUNT

Sign up to GitHub [here](https://github.com/signup).

> [!TIP]
> I recommend using a non-work email address. You can ensure your work is accesisble to a company GitHub account later by adding our team's account as a collaborator to your projects

# üî® Enable XCode Command Line Tools 

**1. Launch a Terminal window**

Type `CMD + Space` and type "Terminal"

**2. Install XCode Developer Tools**

```
xcode-select --install
```
Approve all installation prompts and, once finished, quit and reopen your terminal.

**3. Verify Installation**

```
git --version
``` 

If installation was successful, you'll see a version number. Else, you'll get an error.

# ‚òïÔ∏è Install Homebrew

**1. Run Installation Script**

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**2. Complete Homembrew Setup**

Once Homebrew is finished downloading, you should see a "Next steps" section containing three commands for you to run on your Terminal.

For each of the 3 highlighted lines below: Select and copy the entire line from your Terminal, paste it on the command line, and hit `RETURN`

You may copy-paste as usual by selecting the text and hitting `Cmd + C` and `Cmd +V`

# VSCode

VSCode is a GUI code editor which seamlessly integrates with extensions such as `codex`, `claude code`, etc.

If you'll be vibe-coding, I recommend installing VSCode as it will allow you to make changes more easily if you ever need to make small manual edits.
